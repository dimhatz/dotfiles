Conky width currently is 31px
Tint2 width must be at least that size, so that openbox’s resizing sequence does not bump into it’s border (openbox performs “window move” 6 times as a workaround to ensure that the last border it bumps into is the panel’s on the left or end of screen on the right).
Thus, setting tint2’s width to >=31px is to ensure less flicker due to less border bumping.
Also better setting it to multiples of 2, so that when dividing screen side-by-side there is no 1px gap, that may cause more flicker as above.
-----------------------
In order to get graphical prompt for root authentication, we must be running:
/usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
To make it autostart, we must copy its file from /etc/xdg/autostart to ~/.config/autostart and add to “OnlyShowIn” field “OPENBOX;” ← seems to work only when all capital to recognize openbox session!!!

To disable updates use “software and updates utility”, aka software-properties-gtk.
To check whether the effect took place, see files:
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
and whether any unattended upgrades were made:
ls -l /var/lib/apt/periodic/

Materia gtk theme:
sudo apt install materia-gtk-theme
(materia gtk theme causes xfce panel’s indicator plugin (the one with volume indicator) to load 100% 1 cpu core. Bug description and workarounds here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-indicator-plugin/+bug/1583164
)
Adapta gtk theme:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tista/adapta
sudo apt-get update
Arc theme:
sudo apt install arc-theme
-----------------------
tint2 notification area: When using Faenza-darkest and other Faenza themes, the icon of nm-applet becomes small when setting vertical and horiz offsets to 4 (considering a width of the panel 32, 2px border on notif. area). This has as a result, the icon to be found from another theme, and it is a dark one.

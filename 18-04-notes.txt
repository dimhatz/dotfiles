Conky width currently is 31px
Tint2 width must be at least that size, so that openbox’s resizing sequence does not bump into it’s border (openbox performs “window move” 6 times as a workaround to ensure that the last border it bumps into is the panel’s on the left or end of screen on the right).
Thus, setting tint2’s width to >=31px is to ensure less flicker due to less border bumping.
Also better setting it to multiples of 2, so that when dividing screen side-by-side there is no 1px gap, that may cause more flicker as above.
-----------------------
In order to get graphical prompt for root authentication, we must be running:
/usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
To make it autostart, we must copy its file from /etc/xdg/autostart to ~/.config/autostart and add to “OnlyShowIn” field “OPENBOX;” ← seems to work only when all capital to recognize openbox session!!!

Obconf's openbox settings is unable to correctly set font to "Ubuntu Bold" and sets it to "Ubuntu Medium". To change it edit rc.xml and choose "Ubuntu" as font and "Bold" instead of "Normal".

To disable updates use “software and updates utility”, aka software-properties-gtk.
To check whether the effect took place, see files:
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
and whether any unattended upgrades were made:
ls -l /var/lib/apt/periodic/

Materia gtk theme:
sudo apt install materia-gtk-theme
(materia gtk theme causes xfce panel’s indicator plugin (the one with volume indicator) to load 100% 1 cpu core. Bug description and workarounds here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-indicator-plugin/+bug/1583164
)
Adapta gtk theme:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tista/adapta
sudo apt-get update
Arc theme:
sudo apt install arc-theme

WARNING: ~/.gtkrc-2.0 and ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini are overwritten by lxappearance, by rm'ing first, so do not symlink them when installing them, just cp!
-----------------------
tint2 notification area: When using Faenza-darkest and other Faenza themes, the icon of nm-applet becomes small when setting vertical and horiz offsets to 4 (considering a width of the panel 32, 2px border on notif. area). This has as a result, the icon to be found from another theme, and it is a dark one.

Fonts

Do not use conf.d directory inside ~/.config/fontconfig/ with linking into conf.d from /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ because they are not guaranteed to override the ones in /etc/fonts/conf.d/
This is because if they use <edit ... mode="append"> the value will not be overwritten.
Better to just put everything in ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf like this:
<match target="font">
	<edit name="rgba" mode="assign"><const>rgb</const></edit>
</match>

Also note that *no reloading* is needed to change configurations like above.
Just kill all instances of the app and restart it to see changes.
To make sure the config is read:
FC_DEBUG=1024 thunar
will print debug messages for reading configs and their order, and since user settings have prefix 50-user.conf there are more confs loaded afterwards: 60-* etc. It is possible but not likely that those override user settings, as most of them will just append.

For checking whether fontconfig settings (ex. for Ubuntu font) are applied correctly and not overriden by another .conf: 
fc-match --verbose Ubuntu
and it will report all the hinting settings, ex: hitstyle: 1 means hintslight, see the fontconfig docs table with constants names and their values (man fonts-conf).

lxappearance seems to set font settings in ~/.gtkrc-2.0 and ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, along with other options. However, the font rendering setting seems to be correctly recognized (like hintfull) but impossible to set from lxappearance: no effect and upon lxappearance's restart the values return to the old ones. OTOH, in XFCE's appearance app there are immediate changes - its because it (also) sets Xresources Xft values (not sure whether XFCE stores the other settings in a separate place - most likely)
That is confirmed by running:
appres Xft
appres xft
(the second one is for instances? - check my .Xresources file with more info on the difference)
Also, to check all the Xresources values set by user (not the system defaults, as opposed to appres that will print those too):
xrdb -query

The conclusion is: most likely the applications themselves choose first Xresources Xft settings, and only after that fontconfig and gtkrc and the rest. The only way to ensure correct rendering is to set all 3!!!
